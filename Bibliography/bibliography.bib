   abstract = {Single-cell sequencing is challenging owing to the limited biological material available in an individual cell and the high cost of sequencing across multiple cells. Cao et al. developed a two-step combinatorial barcoding method to profile both single-cell and single-nucleus transcriptomes without requiring physical isolation of each cell. The authors profiled almost 50,000 single cells from an individual Caenorhabditis elegans larval stage and were able to identify and recover information from different, even rare, cell types. Science, this issue p. 661 Single-cell combinatorial indexing RNA sequencing achieves more than 50-fold cellular coverage of a developing nematode worm. To resolve cellular heterogeneity, we developed a combinatorial indexing strategy to profile the transcriptomes of single cells or nuclei, termed sci-RNA-seq (single-cell combinatorial indexing RNA sequencing). We applied sci-RNA-seq to profile nearly 50,000 cells from the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans at the L2 larval stage, which provided &gt;50-fold “shotgun” cellular coverage of its somatic cell composition. From these data, we defined consensus expression profiles for 27 cell types and recovered rare neuronal cell types corresponding to as few as one or two cells in the L2 worm. We integrated these profiles with whole-animal chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data to deconvolve the cell type–specific effects of transcription factors. The data generated by sci-RNA-seq constitute a powerful resource for nematode biology and foreshadow similar atlases for other organisms.},

   volume = {5},

   abstract = {While gene expression profiling is commonly used to gain an overview of cellular processes, the identification of upstream processes that drive expression changes remains a challenge. To address this issue, we introduce CARNIVAL, a causal network contextualization tool which derives network architectures from gene expression footprints. CARNIVAL (CAusal Reasoning pipeline for Network identification using Integer VALue programming) integrates different sources of prior knowledge including signed and directed protein–protein interactions, transcription factor targets, and pathway signatures. The use of prior knowledge in CARNIVAL enables capturing a broad set of upstream cellular processes and regulators, leading to a higher accuracy when benchmarked against related tools. Implementation as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem guarantees efficient computation. As a case study, we applied CARNIVAL to contextualize signaling networks from gene expression data in IgA nephropathy (IgAN), a condition that can lead to chronic kidney disease. CARNIVAL identified specific signaling pathways and associated mediators dysregulated in IgAN including Wnt and TGF-β, which we subsequently validated experimentally. These results demonstrated how CARNIVAL generates hypotheses on potential upstream alterations that propagate through signaling networks, providing insights into diseases.},

   abstract = {Unraveling how cellular signaling is remodeled upon perturbation is crucial for understanding disease mechanisms and identifying potential drug targets. In this pursuit, computational tools generating mechanistic hypotheses from multi-omics data have invaluable potential. Here, we present a newly implemented version (2.0) of SignalingProfiler, a multi-step pipeline to draw mechanistic hypotheses on the signaling events impacting cellular phenotypes. SignalingProfiler 2.0 derives context-specific signaling networks by integrating proteogenomic data with the prior knowledge-causal network. This is a freely accessible and flexible tool that incorporates statistical, footprint-based, and graph algorithms to accelerate the integration and interpretation of multi-omics data. Through a benchmarking process on three proof-of-concept studies, we demonstrate the tool’s ability to generate hierarchical mechanistic networks recapitulating novel and known perturbed signaling and phenotypic outcomes, in both human and mice contexts. In summary, SignalingProfiler 2.0 addresses the emergent need to derive biologically relevant information from complex multi-omics data by extracting interpretable networks.},
