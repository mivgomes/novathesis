The introduction of several new astonishingly expensive prescription drugs has rekindled debate over the origins of and justifications for those prices. At a press conference in Boston last November, the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development announced it had calculated that it costs pharmaceutical companies $2.6 billion to develop a new drug1 — up from the $802 million the Center estimated in 2003. Because the new findings were presented at a media event that offered limited information regarding the methods used to arrive at this figure, it is difficult to know much about the solidity of the approach .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.},

A variety of molecular representations and metrics are applied to computationally evaluate and quantify molecular similarity. A critically important aspect of molecular similarity analysis in chemoinformatics and pharmaceutical research is that one is typically not interested in quantifying the degree of structural or chemical similarity between compounds per se, but rather in extrapolating from molecular similarity to property similarity. In other words, one assumes that there is a correlation between calculated similarity and specific properties of small molecules including, first and foremost, biological activities. Although similarity is a priori a subjective concept, and difficult to quantify, it must computationally be assessed in a formally consistent manner. Otherwise, there is little utility of similarity calculations. Consistent treatment requires approximations to be made and the consideration of alternative computational similarity concepts, as discussed herein.},

Cao et al. developed a two-step combinatorial barcoding method to profile both single-cell and single-nucleus transcriptomes without requiring physical isolation of each cell. The authors profiled almost 50,000 single cells from an individual Caenorhabditis elegans larval stage and were able to identify and recover information from different, even rare, cell types. Science, this issue p. 661 Single-cell combinatorial indexing RNA sequencing achieves more than 50-fold cellular coverage of a developing nematode worm. To resolve cellular heterogeneity, we developed a combinatorial indexing strategy to profile the transcriptomes of single cells or nuclei, termed sci-RNA-seq (single-cell combinatorial indexing RNA sequencing). We applied sci-RNA-seq to profile nearly 50,000 cells from the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans at the L2 larval stage, which provided &gt;50-fold “shotgun” cellular coverage of its somatic cell composition. From these data, we defined consensus expression profiles for 27 cell types and recovered rare neuronal cell types corresponding to as few as one or two cells in the L2 worm. We integrated these profiles with whole-animal chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data to deconvolve the cell type–specific effects of transcription factors. The data generated by sci-RNA-seq constitute a powerful resource for nematode biology and foreshadow similar atlases for other organisms.},

   abstract = {Motivation: Large-scale gene expression profiling has been widely used to characterize cellular states in response to various disease conditions, genetic perturbations, etc. Although the cost of whole-genome expression profiles has been dropping steadily, generating a compendium of expression profiling over thousands of samples is still very expensive. Recognizing that gene expressions are often highly correlated, researchers from the NIH LINCS program have developed a cost-effective strategy of profiling only ∼1000 carefully selected landmark genes and relying on computational methods to infer the expression of remaining target genes. However, the computational approach adopted by the LINCS program is currently based on linear regression (LR), limiting its accuracy since it does not capture complex nonlinear relationship between expressions of genes.Results: We present a deep learning method (abbreviated as D-GEX) to infer the expression of target genes from the expression of landmark genes. We used the microarray-based Gene Expression Omnibus dataset, consisting of 111K expression profiles, to train our model and compare its performance to those from other methods. In terms of mean absolute error averaged across all genes, deep learning significantly outperforms LR with 15.33% relative improvement. A gene-wise comparative analysis shows that deep learning achieves lower error than LR in 99.97% of the target genes. We also tested the performance of our learned model on an independent RNA-Seq-based GTEx dataset, which consists of 2921 expression profiles. Deep learning still outperforms LR with 6.57% relative improvement, and achieves lower error in 81.31% of the target genes.Availability and implementation: D-GEX is available at https://github.com/uci-cbcl/D-GEX.Contact:  xhx@ics.uci.eduSupplementary information:  Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

A platform is, essentially, a list of probes that define what set of molecules may be detected. A sample describes the set of molecules that are being probed and references a single platform used to generate its molecular abundance data.

   abstract = {Prediction of transcription factor (TF) activities from the gene expression of their targets (i.e. TF regulon) is becoming a widely-used approach to characterize the functional status of transcriptional regulatory circuits. Several strategies and datasets have been proposed to link the target genes likely regulated by a TF, each one providing a different level of evidence. The most established ones are: (i) manually curated repositories, (ii) interactions derived from ChIP-seq binding data, (iii) in silico prediction of TF binding on gene promoters, and (iv) reverse-engineered regulons from large gene expression datasets. However, it is not known how these different sources of regulons affect the TF activity estimations, and thereby downstream analysis and interpretation. Here we compared the accuracy and biases of these strategies to define human TF regulons by means of their ability to predict changes in TF activities in three reference benchmark datasets. We assembled a collection of TF-target interactions among 1,541 TFs, and evaluated how the different molecular and regulatory properties of the TFs, such as the DNA-binding domain, specificities or mode of interaction with the chromatin, affect the predictions of TF activity changes. We assessed their coverage and found little overlap on the regulons derived from each strategy and better performance by literature-curated information followed by ChIP-seq data. We provide an integrated resource of all TF-target interactions derived through these strategies with a confidence score, as a resource for enhanced prediction of TF activities.},

Such resources enable the characterization of signatures from novel perturbations based on similarity; provide a global view of the space of many themed perturbations; and allow the ability to predict cellular, tissue, and organismal phenotypes for perturbagens. A signature search engine enables hypothesis generation by finding connections between query signatures and the database of signatures. This framework has been used to identify connections between small molecules and their targets, to discover cell-specific responses to perturbations and ways to reverse disease expression states with small molecules, and to predict small-molecule mimickers for existing drugs. This review provides a historical perspective and the current state of connectivity mapping resources with a focus on both methodology and community implementations.},

   abstract = {In this chapter, we present an approach that allows a causal analysis of multiple “-omics” data with the help of an “upstream analysis” strategy. The goal of this approach is to identify master regulators in gene regulatory networks as potential drug targets for a pathological process. The data analysis strategy includes a state-of-the-art promoter analysis for potential transcription factor (TF)-binding sites using the TRANSFAC® database combined with an analysis of the upstream signal transduction pathways that control the activity of these TFs. When applied to genes that are associated with a switch to a pathological process, the approach identifies potential key molecules (master regulators) that may exert major control over and maintenance of transient stability of the pathological state. We demonstrate this approach on examples of analysis of multi-omics data sets that contain transcriptomics and epigenomics data in cancer. The results of this analysis helped us to better understand the molecular mechanisms of cancer development and cancer drug resistance. Such an approach promises to be very effective for rapid and accurate identification of cancer drug targets with true potential. The upstream analysis approach is implemented as an automatic workflowworkflowin the geneXplain platform (www.genexplain.com) using the open-source BioUML framework (www.biouml.org).},

IntAct has developed a sophisticated web-based curation tool, capable of supporting both IMEx- and MIMIx-level curation. This tool is now utilized by multiple additional curation teams, all of whom annotate data directly into the IntAct database. Members of the IntAct team supply appropriate levels of training, perform quality control on entries and take responsibility for long-term data maintenance. Recently, the MINT and IntAct databases decided to merge their separate efforts to make optimal use of limited developer resources and maximize the curation output. All data manually curated by the MINT curators have been moved into the IntAct database at EMBL-EBI and are merged with the existing IntAct dataset. Both IntAct and MINT are active contributors to the IMEx consortium (http://www.imexconsortium.org).},

Additionally, computational methods such as structure-based drug designing can be utilized to make drug discovery more efficient and more accurate. Now imagine what can be achieved by combining drug repurposing and computational methods together in drug discovery, “in silico repurposing.” In this chapter, we tried to describe a method that combines structure-based virtual screening and molecular dynamics simulation which can find effective compounds among existing drugs that may affect on a specific molecular target. By using molecular docking as a tool for the screening process and then by calculating ligand binding in an active receptor site using scoring functions and inspecting the proper orientation of pharmacophores in the binding site, the potential compounds will be chosen. After that, in order to test the potential compounds in a realistic environment, molecular dynamics simulation and related analysis have to be carried out for separating the false positives and the true positives from each other and finally identifying true “Hit” compounds. It’s good to emphasize that if any of these identified potential compounds turn out to have the efficacy to affect that specific molecular target, it can be taken to the phase 2 clinical trials straightaway.},

   journal = {bioRxiv},
   pages = {2022.09.14.508054},
   abstract = {Drug repurposing is an approach to identify new therapeutic applications for existing drugs and small molecules. It is a field of growing research interest due to its time and cost effectiveness as compared with de novo drug discovery. One method for drug repurposing is to adopt a systems biology approach to associate molecular ‘signatures’ of drug and disease. Drugs which have an inverse relationship with the disease signature may be able to reverse the molecular effects of the disease and thus be candidates for repurposing. Conversely, drugs which mimic the disease signatures can inform on potential molecular mechanisms of disease. The relationship between these disease and drug signatures are quantified through connectivity scores. Identifying a suitable drug-disease scoring method is key for in silico drug repurposing, so as to obtain an accurate representation of the true drug-disease relationship. There are several methods to calculate these connectivity scores, notably the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS), Zhang and eXtreme Sum (XSum). However, these methods can provide discordant estimations of the drug-disease relationship and this discordance can affect the drug-disease indication. Using the gene expression profiles from the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) database, we evaluated the methods based on their drug-disease connectivity scoring performance. In this first-of-its-kind analysis, we varied the quality of disease signatures by using only highly differential genes or by the inclusion of non-differential genes. Further, we simulated noisy disease signatures by introducing varying levels of noise into the gene expression signatures. Overall, we found that there was not one method that outperformed the others in all instances, but the Zhang method performs well in a majority of our analyses. Our results provide a framework to evaluate connectivity scoring methods, and considerations for deciding which scoring method to apply in future systems biology studies for drug repurposing.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

   abstract = {The elucidation of a compound's Mechanism of Action (MoA) is a challenging task in the drug discovery process, but it is important in order to rationalise phenotypic findings and to anticipate potential side-effects. Bioinformatic approaches, advances in machine learning techniques and the increasing deposition of high-throughput data in public databases have significantly contributed to recent advances in the field, but it is not straightforward to decide which data and methods are most suitable to use in a given case. In this review, we focus on these methods and data and their applications in generating MoA hypotheses for subsequent experimental validation. We discuss compound-specific data such as -omics, cell morphology and bioactivity data, as well as commonly used supplementary prior knowledge such as network and pathway data, and provide information on databases where this data can be accessed. In terms of methodologies, we discuss both well-established methods (connectivity mapping, pathway enrichment) as well as more developing methods (neural networks and multi-omics integration). Finally, we review case studies where the MoA of a compound was successfully suggested from computational analysis by incorporating multiple data modalities and/or methodologies. Our aim for this review is to provide researchers with insights into the benefits and drawbacks of both the data and methods in terms of level of understanding, biases and interpretation – and to highlight future avenues of investigation which we foresee will improve the field of MoA elucidation, including greater public access to -omics data and methodologies which are capable of data integration.},

   abstract = {Unraveling how cellular signaling is remodeled upon perturbation is crucial for understanding disease mechanisms and identifying potential drug targets. In this pursuit, computational tools generating mechanistic hypotheses from multi-omics data have invaluable potential. Here, we present a newly implemented version (2.0) of SignalingProfiler, a multi-step pipeline to draw mechanistic hypotheses on the signaling events impacting cellular phenotypes. SignalingProfiler 2.0 derives context-specific signaling networks by integrating proteogenomic data with the prior knowledge-causal network. This is a freely accessible and flexible tool that incorporates statistical, footprint-based, and graph algorithms to accelerate the integration and interpretation of multi-omics data. Through a benchmarking process on three proof-of-concept studies, we demonstrate the tool’s ability to generate hierarchical mechanistic networks recapitulating novel and known perturbed signaling and phenotypic outcomes, in both human and mice contexts. In summary, SignalingProfiler 2.0 addresses the emergent need to derive biologically relevant information from complex multi-omics data by extracting interpretable networks.},

   abstract = {Drug repurposing (DR) offers a promising alternative to the high cost and low success rate of traditional drug development, especially for complex diseases like Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This study addressed DR for AD from three key angles: (1) demonstrating how disease-specific knowledge graphs can improve DR performance, (2) evaluating the role of large language models (LLMs) in enhancing the usability and efficiency of these graphs, and (3) assessing whether Graph-of-Thoughts (GoT)-enhanced LLMs, when integrated with AD knowledge graphs, can outperform traditional machine learning and LLM-based approaches. We tested five distinct DR strategies (DR1–DR5) for AD: DR1, a machine learning method using TxGNN; DR2, a machine learning model leveraging the Alzheimer’s KnowledgeBase (AlzKB); DR3, an LLM-based chatbot built on AlzKB; DR4, our ESCARGOT framework combining GoT-enhanced LLMs with AlzKB; and DR5, a general reasoning-driven LLM approach. Results showed that AlzKB significantly improved DR outcomes. ESCARGOT further enhanced performance while reducing the need for coding or advanced expertise in knowledge graph analysis. Because the architecture of AlzKB is easily adaptable to other diseases and ESCARGOT can integrate with various knowledge graph platforms, this framework offers a broadly applicable, innovative tool for accelerating drug discovery through repurposing.},

These innovative sequencing techniques empower researchers to dissect perturbation effects in biological systems at an unprecedented resolution. Despite these advancements, a notable gap exists in the availability of a dedicated database for exploring scPerturbation data. To address this gap, we present PerturBase, the most comprehensive database designed for the analysis and visualization of scPerturbation data (http://www.perturbase.cn/). PerturBase curates 122 datasets from 46 publicly available studies, covering 115 single-modal and 7 multi-modal datasets that include 24 254 genetic and 230 chemical perturbations from approximately 5 million cells. The database, comprising the ‘Dataset’ and ‘Perturbation’ modules, provides insights into various results, encompassing quality control, denoising, differential gene expression analysis, functional analysis of perturbation effects and characterization of relationships between perturbations. All the datasets and results are presented on user-friendly, easy-to-browse web pages and can be visualized through intuitive and interactive plot and table formats. In summary, PerturBase stands as a pioneering, high-content database intended for searching, visualizing and analyzing scPerturbation datasets, contributing to a deeper understanding of perturbation effects.},

   abstract = {Network-based computational biology, with the emphasis on biomolecular interactions and omics-data integration, has had success in drug development and created new directions such as drug repositioning and drug combination. Drug repositioning, i.e., revealing a drug's new roles, is increasingly attracting much attention from the pharmaceutical community to tackle the problems of high failure rate and long-term development in drug discovery. While drug combination or drug cocktails, i.e., combining multiple drugs against diseases, mainly aims to alleviate the problems of the recurrent emergence of drug resistance and also reveal their synergistic effects. In this paper, we unify the two topics to reveal new roles of drug interactions from a network perspective by treating drug combination as another form of drug repositioning. In particular, first, we emphasize that rationally repositioning drugs in the large scale is driven by the accumulation of various high-throughput genome-wide data. These data can be utilized to capture the interplay among targets and biological molecules, uncover the resulting network structures, and further bridge molecular profiles and phenotypes. This motivates many network-based computational methods on these topics. Second, we organize these existing methods into two categories, i.e., single drug repositioning and drug combination, and further depict their main features by three data sources. Finally, we discuss the merits and shortcomings of these methods and pinpoint some future topics in this promising field.},

Pharmaceutical discovery relies on high-throughput screening, yet current platforms have limited readouts. RNA-seq is a powerful tool to investigate drug effects using transcriptome changes as a proxy, yet standard library construction is costly. DRUG-seq captures transcriptional changes detected in standard RNA-seq at 1/100th the cost. In proof-of-concept experiments profiling 433 compounds across 8 doses, transcription profiles generated from DRUG-seq successfully grouped compounds into functional clusters by mechanism of actions (MoAs) based on their intended targets. Perturbation differences reflected in transcriptome changes were detected for compounds engaging the same target, demonstrating the value of using DRUG-seq for understanding on and off-target activities. We demonstrate DRUG-seq captures common mechanisms, as well as differences between compound treatment and CRISPR on the same target. DRUG-seq provides a powerful tool for comprehensive transcriptome readout in a high-throughput screening environment.},
